## Overview of Analysis
V. Isualize has tasked us with a new assisgnment. Using our new skills we are to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then to graph out our new DataFrame to easily show the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

As you can see, the farther away from urban centers you get the less rides become avalable. Because of this there are fewer drivers in both the Suburban and Rural city types competing for rides. This fact leads to both Average Fare per Ride and per Driver being higher in both city types.

Urban is king! And this chart shows that beautifully. In this very samll sample size we are working with we see that Rural is very steady between 0-500, but both Suburban and Urban have a slightly higher variance at approx 700. 

## Summary
1) The study needs to be increased to incorporate the entire year and the two years previous in order to recognise any trends.
2) This will allow you to notice if the amount of drivers and rides either increase or decrease in the Suburban/Rural city types. With that you will be able to determine    if you need more drivers in that area or more education. 
     * Do people stop using the service because there are no drivers?
     * Do people not use that service because they do not know the benefits? 
3) When looking at the line graph above we see a peak in all three areas at the end of February. What happenned at that point? Sporting event? Concert? Looking at          several years of data to see if there any other significant peaks you will be able to prepare your advertising campaign based on upcoming events.
