## Results

As you can easily see, the farther away from urban centers you get the less rides become avalable per driver. But in both the Rural and Suburban areas there are less drivers than rides, which is why they have a much higher Fare per Driver than the Urban drivers.

Urban is king! And this chart shows that beautifully. The interesting things that pop up here are the peaks and valleys on the line graph. There are distinct similarities in both as late february and the beginning or march show us.
